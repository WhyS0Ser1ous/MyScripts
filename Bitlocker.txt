How to:
1.	Ping the machines that are tag as No on the encryption tab. Use script below:
a.	$servers = Get-Content "C:\Users\jene9505\Documents\pcnames.txt"
ForEach ($server in $servers) {
Try {
$IP = ((Test-Connection -ea stop -Count 1 -comp $server).IPV4Address).IPAddresstoString
$x = "$server - UP - $($IP)"
Write-Host($x) -ForegroundColor green
}
Catch {
$y = "$server - Down - Offline"
Write-Host($y) -ForegroundColor red
}
}

2.	Then remediate those machines that are pingable/active:
If a system is already encrypted but does not show the bitlocker password in AD, you could try the following:

1.	Check if you can retrieve the recoverykey GUID from a powershell window with the following command line.
(Get-BitLockerVolume -MountPoint $env:SystemDrive).keyprotector | where {$_.Keyprotectortype -eq 'RecoveryPassword'} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty KeyProtectorID 
2.	If it gives an output – something like {XXXXXXXX……}, then you should be able to use that to back up to AD (while connected to corp network over VPN or over the LAN) – replace the {XXXXXXXXXXX…..} with whatever output you got from the previous command line.
manage-bde -protectors $env:SystemDrive -adbackup -id ‘{XXXXXXXXXXXXX……………………………………}’

 

Wait a few minutes for the changes to replicate in AD and check if it got backed up. Let me know if that doesn’t work for you.
